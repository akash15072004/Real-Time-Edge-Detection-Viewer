# Real-Time-Edge-Detection-Viewer
This project provides a browser-based implementation of an edge detection viewer, built as a Web Component for easy reuse in any web application. It uses the user’s webcam or video input to run edge-detection filters (e.g., Canny, Sobel) in real time, and exposes a clean API for integration.
